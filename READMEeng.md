# WZSS Shader Plus Documentation
Language：English [中文](./README.md) 
  
        This repository is used to archive the technical documentation(as I understand) for the MOW II based custom shader system (GSM).
        and the development guide for the WZSS Shader Plus (WSP) mod to guide any author wishing to use this mod to enhance the graphics properly.
        and the graphics material I learned while implementing WSP to help any hobbyist who wants to write shaders on that game advance his work.
        
I used deepl + simple proofreading to translate this document to English, if there are any errors please send me an issue.

## Support my Work
First of all, if you like my products, please give this repository a STAR, I'd appreciate it =)  
  
Secondly, you can support my work with **money** in the following ways, but any direct benefits you can get is **LIMITED** to the fact that you'll be given more weight for making suggestions to WSP. Or I will prioritize your suggestions. **However** on top of that, the difficulty of implementing a new suggestion, other people's opinions and my personal schedule, and other necessary issues **still** will be taken into account to determine if it should actually be prioritized.

At the same time, all development results remain completely free and open source. I think this is important: there will be no backer specials, no prioritized benefits, and the results should be shared by all.  
If you're interested in my approach, feel free to read further [some of my ideas](./en/additional/openSource.md).
